                <h3><i>Floating in the Pond since 29/01/2022</i></h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to this website (read: webpage) which has a very odd name and a very odd, and perhaps aesthetically uninspiring
                    design. The name, as simple as it sounds, has no correlation to any object of significance. The Pond is a 
                    representation of (a subset) of my thoughts, and the Duck, is me. The name could have had "interesting"
                    or fancier sounding words, but that's not the purpose. Just as there are millions of ponds in the world and
                    a good chunk of them having ducks with them, there are 7+ billion people in this world, and each having their
                    unique set of thoughts and stories with them. No one, single person is special, but everyone is indeed <b>special</b>. 
                    No matter how common a pond is, for a duck, its pond is its universe, the source of its happiness. 
                    Similarly, for us, our thoughts are what we are defined by, what we live by, some thoughts may be truly unique, or
                    ground breaking, some may be really common, but the only thing that matters at the end of the day is that they are 
                    our thoughts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Okay, that's really cool and all, but then why share your 'Pond' with the Internet?" might be your natural next 
                    question. Well, short answer is I don't know for sure. I feel like sharing thoughts and experiences with others is a 
                    privilege and one of the best things we, as Humans can do. If my thoughts resonate with yours, or they make you 
                    shudder in resentment, I will be happy knowing that you decided to listen out to them, and were capable to process them 
                    and form your own peace with it. As a reader, you have the privilege of judging me based on the limited subset of knowledge
                    you have about my thinking process, whereas I can only assume what the majority might perceive. I only hope that through
                    this medium, this <b>passage</b> we can have a healthy (mostly one-sided) conversation. Should you wish to contact me 
                    personally or respond to an individual piece, you can do so via e-mail :)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that the "What?" and "Why?" are out of the way. Let's go to "How?"
                    Everything here, is put together in a single page. Every single article, or rather, a <i>piece</i>, is on
                    this one, single HTML file. No matter how large this file gets, this will be the only file on the webserver. 
                    As a nice experiment, the number of lines of code is mentioned above!
                    There will not be any images, rather ASCII-generated recreations of the images. The color schreme is monochrome.
                    And the only structural entities will be text/characters. The only thing, which will be 
                    "external", in regards to this webpage are hyperlinks to external sources. As always, credits should be due where they are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each piece will be numbered. This piece has <img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c26c105004f30c27aa7c2a9c601550a4183b1f21" class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline" aria-hidden="true" style="vertical-align: -0.338ex; width:2.324ex; height:1.676ex;" alt="\infty "> 
                    as its <i>number</i>, since this will always be sticking out at the top. The only organizational (or rather navigational) structure enforced are hyperlinks, 
                    which present to navigate around each piece. The content of this piece <i>may</i> change, as appropriate, but for every single piece 
                    after this, there will <b>NOT</b> be any changes made to the piece once it's out there or published or what I term as <i>'floating'</i>. 
                    Any change of mind would have to be in a separate piece itself. If there are minor grammatical mistakes, they will be ironed out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason for this absurb "No Edit" design is as follows: The words, once uttered, cannot be taken back. <br>
                    The reason for this absurd "Single Page" design is as follows: Our thoughts and our conscience are a single unit,
                    not a collection of things organized for convenience of access for anyone, including self. <br>
                    The reason for this absurd aesthetic design is as follows: The 'Pond' is supposed to be the collection of my thoughts, 
                    and no matter what media we use, you can never access the mental picture I have. So I decided not to include any thing
                    aside from text, and characters, the basis of language. Language is the most basic means of getting your thoughts across 
                    after all. (Plus, you get to form your own imaginations, like reading a book!). 
                    Also, there are no fancy CSS/JavaScript stuff, just pure text. After all, what truly matters is not how my thoughts <i>look</i>
                    but how they are read and understood.
                    This website is just a <i>HTML-version of a PDF</i>
